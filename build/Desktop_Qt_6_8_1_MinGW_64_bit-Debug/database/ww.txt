Humanity is currently facing the severe issue of climate change, driven by the constant release of greenhouse gases. This phenomenon has caused global warming, which in turn has led to the melting of glaciers and an increase in sea levels. Moreover, extreme weather events like hurricanes, droughts, and floods have become more frequent. Addressing this problem requires the use of renewable energy, minimizing carbon emissions, and enforcing policies that encourage sustainable practices.
